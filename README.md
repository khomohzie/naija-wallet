# NaijaWallet

A modern digital wallet and banking app for Nigeria, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. NaijaWallet enables users to securely manage their finances, send money to other wallets or bank accounts, and view recent transactionsâ€”all with a beautiful, responsive UI.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in with email, phone, and password. OTP verification is supported.
- **Wallet Dashboard**: View wallet balance, recent transactions, and quick actions after login.
- **Send Money**: Transfer funds to other NaijaWallet users or to Nigerian bank accounts (mocked with Fineract, NIBSS, and Flutterwave integrations).
- **Transaction History**: See a list of recent debits and credits, including top-ups and transfers.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with styled-components and shadcn/ui, leveraging Tailwind CSS for rapid styling.
- **Mocked Backend Services**: All services (auth, wallet, payment, transaction) are mocked for demo purposes, simulating real-world APIs.
